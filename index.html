<h1> <span class="white">Hello World</span></h1>
<p><span class="white">Hello everyone, my name is Justin Lai. I am 17 years old and was born and raised in San Francisco. I go to Balboa High School and I like learning different languages. I just finished my third year of French and plan on self teaching myself another language online before I go to university, where I will learn another language and hopefully study abroad.</span></p>

<p><span class="grey">Something that I am more passionate about than languages is playing video games. I have been playing video games since I was five years old, starting out with RuneScape, then eventually branching out to a multitude of games. In sixth grade, Counter Strike Global Offensive came out and I got hooked on it. I eventually reached the second highest rank in the summer before ninth grade, and making it into the CEVO Main League for a single season.</span></p>

<p><span class="black">In the future, I would like to go to UCI for computer science and try to get a programming job at a famous company like Google, Youtube, or Twitch. I hope that in the future, I can make enough money to be able to travel all over the world. I wish to be able to travel to every continent before the age of 30.</span></p>
