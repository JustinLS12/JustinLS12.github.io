<h1>Smart Mirror Project</h1>
<br>

<h4>Created by Justin Lai, Francisco Galicia, and Michael Antoun</h4>
<br>
<br>

<p>At the UCSF Library, there is a space called the Maker's Lab, where there are numerous 3D printers, Raspberry PIs, and other cool electronics for students and staff of UCSF to use free of charge. During our internship at the UCSF library, we decided to use the Maker's Lab to create our own smart mirror</p>


<p>In the most basic form, a smart mirror is your ordinary, everyday mirror, something you can use to help put on make-up, or to fix your hair, but with a calendar, news, weather, and air traffic reports.</p>


<p>We created this smart mirror out of a monitor, a Raspberry PI 0, a mirror that allows light through, and wood. First, we plugged the Raspberry PI into the monitor and installed the Magic Mirror application on github, then installed all of the plugins that we wanted. After we installed the plugins, we copied all of the modules into the config.js document and configured all of modules to fit our location, timezone, and to put in the API keys. After the software side of the project was finished, we started assembling the mirror. We created a wooden frame around the monitor, attatched a two-way mirror to the monitor, and velcro-strapped the Raspberry Pi onto the monitor.</p>


<p>All in all, this project was fun, exciting, and generally good experience. It was the first time we've ever done such a project that involved using technology which we've never even touched before, and building something that not many people have heard of, all by ourselves with limited help. Although the project was fun and exciting, it was also very challenging. As it was our first time using a Raspberry PI, we didn't know how to even install applications and plugins on it using the terminal, which we had to learn on our own through trial and error.</p>
